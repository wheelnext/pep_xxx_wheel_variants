# PEP ### - Wheel Variant Support

### Foreword & Context

This repository shows a prototype concept of how `Python Wheels` could be made
specific to any hardware - platform - device (internal or external) - silicone -
etc.

We would like to argue that Python today supports a very wide variety of
platforms, unfortunately the existing following are not sufficient to cover
today's needs:

- Python ABI version
- OS
- CPU architecture
- Build ID

All of which summarized by the following regex:

```python
r"^(?P<namever>(?P<name>[^\s-]+?)-(?P<ver>[^\s-]+?))(-(?P<build>\d[^\s-]*))?-(?P<pyver>[^\s-]+?)-(?P<abi>[^\s-]+?)-(?P<plat>\S+)\.whl$"
```

We argue in this PEP, that multiple wheels with the same Python ABI / OS / CPU
Arch can be built to support different platforms (in a large meaning): CPU-only
vs GPU-enabled vs FPGA-enabled.

### Today, all solutions are suboptimal

- Using dedidacated indexes per platform (one index for GPU wheels, one index
  for CPU wheels, etc.). All of which sharing usually the exact same name though
  having vastly different behavior and/or dependencies and/or features. And to
  add to the injury, if users don't read the documentation with attention, they
  are most likely to end up with a non-functioning install or very suboptimal
  (having a GPU build on a system which doesn't have a GPU - at best unnecessary
  downloads - at worst it won't work altogether). Obviously this approach breaks
  every core python assumptions: `pip freeze` & friends because a "wheel /
  package" with version is not unique.

- Including all dependencies imaginable in one MEGA-Wheel (CPU, NVIDIA GPU, AMD
  GPU, Google TPU, FPGA, etc.) and detecting at runtime "what the platform
  supports" and activating the corresponding code-paths/dependencies. This
  usually makes heavy use of lazy imports and can rapidly lead to a very bloated
  download/install sequence due to the plaetora of unnecessary dependencies
  installed. This appraoch essentially trades "efficiency & network impact" for
  user friendliness (limited need to "read the documentation": just install and
  it works). This approach unfortunately also comes at a high cost "for the
  community" putting a high stress and load on WareHouse (PyPI.org) and we are
  already reaching the limit of what "this approach can do" (total repo size,
  maximum size per wheel, bandwidth generated, etc.).

- One can also create package / metapackage (alias package - empty shells just
  redirecting properly) dedicated per "platform": `mypackage-gpu` or
  `mypackage-cpu`. This approach has some advantages, but still minor drawbacks:
  - Where do you stop: `mypackage-cpu-arm-v7` or `mypackage-cpu-arm-v7.1` ?
    Obviously if you don't force yourself to "stay as generic as possible" you
    rapidly end up with a literal explosion of packages (imagine combining
    multiple "variables" in a combinatorial way).
  - **MOST IMPORTANTLY:** this approach is total death blow to python dependency
    management. How can a package express a dependency of `mypackage` if there
    exist 15 of them. Extra environments maybe ? You better read the
    documentation VERY closely. The easiest/most reasonable is most certainly to
    on-purpose omit the explicit dependency `package -> mypackage` and - at
    runtime - if the import of `mypackage` fails, issue a well formatted error
    message sending the user to the documentation on what version of `mypackage`
    to install and how.

### Wheel Variants: a mechanism to automatically detect "best package match" for the target platform.

A `Wheel Variant` is defined as a "_flavored package_" specific to a certain
number of attributes externally defined / detected and controlled.

Let's imagine the creators of `TARS` (i.e. InterStellar) would want to create a
`Wheel Variant` of `numpy`. Because there is absolutely zero doubt InterStellar
AI is powered by Python, they consequently need to access `numpy` for trajectory
calculations.

### Provider Plugins - How do you detect what platform you're on and decide on the best match.

Which leads us to the concept of `Provider Plugin`, we need a system to detect
the user platform is `TARS` and consequently grab the appropriate
`Python Wheel`. Most likely that system will be designed, released and
maintained by the creator/manufacturer of `TARS`, but nothing prevents anyone to
`fork the provider plugin` and alter the selection logic (license permitting).

Let's say that in our case we `fictional_hw`, to be `Provider Plugin`, it's able
to "scan our machine and determine the best-matching `Variant` for this machine.

### Why a plugin you may ask ?

_Oh my dear friend - I'm glad you ask!_

The core of the rational is that it's impossible to modify PIP (send PRs, etc.)
every single time a new hardware / fix / etc. needs to get released. This would
instantly turn into a massive burden for `PIP` maintainers and nobody wants
that. At the same time,`Provider Plugin` may need to quickly iterate / adjust /
modify their "selection logic" (bug fix, security fix, new product
released/announced). And lastly because it's not part of `PIP` it becomes very
easy for whoever needs it (that need should stay pretty rare though) to "fork
and modify" the selection logic from a hardware vendor (at your own risk) and
fit your needs.

So really, everybody wins in this context to have that "selection logic"
external from `PIP`.

### I thought PIP does not have a public API - How do you implement a "Plugin" ?

_Oh my dear friend - I'm glad you ask (again I know, you have good questions not
my fault) !_

Turns out there's a very elegant (I foresee some people ?preparing to?
disagreeing already) way to allow a "plugin" interface without providing a
public API to `PIP` in any sort of way.

Turns out a `packageA` can register an entrypoint for another `packageB`.

This PEP will be supported by a library called `variantlib`, we propose that all
plugins register an entrypoint as follows:

```toml
[project.entry-points."variantlib.plugins"]
my_plugin = "my_plugin.plugin:MyVariantPlugin"
```

The only constraint is the following, `MyVariantPlugin` needs to follow the
following "structure and signature"

```python
# We will come back on `ProviderConfig` later.
# For now - it's a "standardized way" to express arbitrary metadata
# or attributes that are supported on this machine.
from variantlib.config import ProviderConfig

from my_plugin import __version__


class MyVariantPlugin:
    __provider_name__ = "my_plugin"
    __version__ = __version__

    def run(self) -> ProviderConfig | None:
        """If the plugin is able to determine this platform/machine supports
        custom "attributes/metadata" (defined and known by this plugin):
        => It returns a `ProviderConfig`, otherwise `None` (aka. ignore me).
        ...
```

Nothing more - nothing less.

And in case you need the rest of the story, on PIP side we can then apply the
following:

```python
from importlib.metadata import entry_points
plugins = entry_points().select(group="variantlib.plugins")

for plugin in plugins:
    logger.info(f"Loading plugin: {plugin.name} - v{plugin.dist.version}")

    # Dynamically load the plugin class
    plugin_class = plugin.load()

    # Instantiate the plugin
    plugin_instance = plugin_class()

    # Call the `run` method of the plugin
    ... = plugin_instance.run()

    # do something with the result of the plugins
```

**This approach has so many advantages:**

- It's _standardized_ and the proposed plugin standard is really minimalistic
  and easy to follow / modify as needed.
- `PIP` still does not need to commit to any public API (no
  `from pip import XYZ` in sight)
- Does not require to overwrite files / folders of other packages or drop files
  within the tree of another package.
- Last and not the least complete auto-discovery ! The user need to do nothing
  beyond `pip install myplugin` and the plugin gets auto-discovered when `PIP`
  needs it.

## The Variant-Platform matching process

Alright so now let's put everything back together. We have:

- a package `mypackage` version `A.B.C` - packaged as a normal wheel and as a
  `Wheel Variant` for `TARS` platform.

- a `Variant Provider` plugin `fictional_hw` which plugs into `variantlib`
  providing (hence the name) what kind of `Wheel Variant` are suitable for this
  machine and in what order of preference.

- some new logic inside `PIP` which queries `variantlib.plugins` to determine if
  there is any existing `Wheel Variant` matching the user platform.

We are almost there - let's clear a few points before full demo.

### How can we upload different "wheels" if they all represent the same "release" ?

_Oh my dear friend - I'm glad you ask (again again I know, you have very good
questions) !_

For multiple reasons (explained below), we propose to slightly modify the regex
above by adding a new capture group: `(~(?P<variant_hash>[0-9a-f]{8}))?`
(essentially `~abcd1234` for those who don't speak fluently - not you I know
that you know, other people :D).

This `hash` is constructed in a standardized by `variantlib` (which algorithm to
use could be debated - for now `hashlib.shake_128()`) and only use 8 characters
which is plenty to guarantee unicity.

This `hash` is prefixed by `~` to make the filename extremely obvious to be a
variant (aka. not generic but rather platform specific):
`mypackage-0.0.1~9091cdc4-py3-none-any.whl`. The choice of `~` (instead of `#`
for instance) was made because it's one of the very rare character with doesn't
need escaping or convey a special meaning in a URL (like `#`, `@` or `?`).
Ultimately it could be anything easy to recognize and that doesn't require
complex escape or unintended consequence. `~` is unique and "fill all the
boxes".

Modifying the "wheel validation" regex has one "hidden" major advantage: it
makes any `Variant Wheel` an invalid filename for any version of PIP which does
not support variants. Consequently guaranteeing, this PEP does break any old
release of `PIP` by publishing `Python Wheels` in a previously unsupported.

Consequently on disk - we have the following:

```bash
mypackage-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
mypackage-0.0.1~e684be6f-py3-none-any.whl
mypackage-0.0.1~9091cdc4-py3-none-any.whl
mypackage-0.0.1~6b4c8391-py3-none-any.whl
mypackage-0.0.1~57768a46-py3-none-any.whl
mypackage-0.0.1~4f8ae729-py3-none-any.whl
mypackage-0.0.1~36266d4d-py3-none-any.whl
```

If the user need to know what `mypackage-0.0.1~e684be6f-py3-none-any.whl`
corresponds to, they can open the `METADATA` file which contains the relevant
variant information (which has been hashed).

### From the plugin to the Variant Hash to the Install

Let's pretend the user is doing `pip install fictional_hw` (the plugin) and then
later `pip install package`, how does the whole process look like under the hood
?

1. `PIP` asks `variantlib` to collect all the `ProviderConfig` and generate a
   combinatorial product of possibilities which are "possible on this machine":
   1. `variantlib` calls on each `installed plugin` and ask them to analyze the
      platform (a few example below)
      - do you support AVX 512 ?
      - do you have the NVIDIA driver installed ? which version ?
      - which version of ARM is your CPU (e.g. ARMv7, ARMv8, etc.)
      - what type of networking do you have (e.g. ethernet vs roc-e vs
        infiniband, etc.)

   2. Each Plugin generate a `ProviderConfig` and returns it. This object
      contains all the attribute the plugin was able to match this
      machine/platform with

   3. `variantlib` creates a combinatorial product of all the attributes
      provided by the all the plugins, respecting the priority order
      (user-controllable).

2. `variantlib` generates the `hash value` for each configuration compatible on
   this machine and `PIP` searches - in order - if any matching `Wheel Variant`
   is available on the indexes.

3. Finally, if a `Variant-match` was found => the best match (given the priority
   order) is installed, if none was found - the non-variant package is
   installed: `mypackage-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl`

All that process happens very fast because it's essentially just a generation of
hashes and a look up in a hashmap if a given hash value exists. It's
near-invisible to the user.

## A few design details important for user experience

It is crucial to understand that Wheel Variants are a totally optional mechanism
that probably 99% of packages will never need. However, many of the very
important projects for the Python Community may have a serious usecase for them.
Namely those shipping with compiled binaries.

This proposal aims to propose a framework and mechanism to specify arbitrary
information and resolve them on the user-machine. We try to be as little
specific and/or opiniated on what "information" may mean (hence we used
fictional references). We believe this proposal can be used in ways we don't
necessarily anticipate today and it's by design. We want to leave the freedom in
the design to not specify what doesn't need to specified.

Below are a few detail points of "User Experience" that we tried to consider in
the demonstrator - they appear important to us and we wanted to be able to
provide a full answer to allow you to project yourself into a `Variant-enabled`
future.

1. The relative priority of `pluginA` vs `pluginB` should be either controllable
   using `pip.conf` or using a `pip install --flag` We obviously want to let the
   user decide what plugin should take the precedence if two plugins are
   installed simultaneously.

2. We might envision a command `pip organize_variant_provider` that will provide
   a new UI and modify the `pip.conf` for you in the background (e.g. chose the
   most important plugin, now chosen the second most important, etc.).

3. This mostly concerns supercomputers AFAIK - Some usecases share a unique
   `virtualenv` (in read-only) between thousands of workers. The node doing the
   install of the virtualenv does not necessarily have access to the "real
   production environment", consequently it's important to be able to force the
   resolution to variant `abcd1234` if the user asks for it
   `pip install --force-variant=abcd1234 mypackage`. It's niche but important.

4. A user may also want to disable the `variant` feature/behavior altogether:
   `pip install --no-variant mypackage`

5. I believe for `lockfiles` (discussed in other places) we may want
   `variant infos` to be included (I honestly don't have opinion).

6. To the contrary, I would argue we don't want `variant infos` to be inside
   `pip freeze`. It is frequently used to generate `requirements.txt` files:
   `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, the whole point of `Wheel Variants` is to
   let `PIP` decide what `Wheel Variant` (if any) is most appropriate for a
   given machine. Forcing the variant hash into `pip freeze` (or the
   dependencies/optional-dependencies inside `pyproject.toml`), entirely defeats
   the purpose to have this "resolution" eagerly executed.

7. Each variant provider plugin may want to provide a "debug command"
   `myprovider debug --verbose` or so giving the details of how the platform is
   being analyzed and resolved. We don't believe that interface shall be
   standardized, it shall be up to the plugin authors to decide what information
   they believe useful to help the user understand why they don't get the
   variant they expect to get.
   - Maybe a different plugin has the priority
   - Maybe the detection mechanism has a problem (e.g. some library is missing
     in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
   - Maybe provide a link to a forum / discord / slack / stackoverflow / email /
     github to get support.
   - etc.
